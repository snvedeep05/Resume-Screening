# Resume Screening Automation

An AI-powered resume screening system that automatically extracts, scores, and ranks candidates against job requirements. Built with FastAPI (backend) and Streamlit (frontend), powered by Groq's LLaMA model.

## Recent Updates

### March 2026

#### 1. `/health` Endpoint Added — UptimeRobot Support
**Why:** Render's free tier spins down any web service after **15 minutes of no incoming HTTP requests**. Background processing tasks (resume screening) do not count as activity — so the server was shutting down mid-run on large batches.

**Fix:** Added a public `/health` endpoint in `backend/main.py`. Registered as two separate decorators so GET and HEAD have distinct OpenAPI operation IDs (avoids Swagger duplicate operation ID warning):

```python
@app.get("/health")
def health():
    return {"status": "ok"}

@app.head("/health", include_in_schema=False)
def health_head():
    pass
```

**UptimeRobot setup:** A monitor is configured to ping `{BACKEND_URL}/health` every **5 minutes**, keeping the Render server alive throughout batch runs.

---

#### 2. pdfminer FontBBox Warnings Suppressed
**Why:** Render logs were flooded with repeated harmless warnings from `pdfminer`. Text extraction is unaffected.

**Fix:** Added at the top of `backend/services/resume_processor.py`:
```python
logging.getLogger("pdfminer").setLevel(logging.ERROR)
```

---

#### 3. Re-run Bug Fixed — Failed Resumes Now Re-extracted on Retry
**Fix:** Changed the reuse query to filter `extracted_data IS NOT NULL` so failed rows are not treated as valid cached results:
```python
existing_result = db.query(ResumeResult).filter(
    ResumeResult.resume_id == resume_id,
    ResumeResult.job_id == job_id,
    ResumeResult.extracted_data.isnot(None)
).first()
```

---

#### 4. `failed_count` Not Persisting After Rollback — Fixed
**Why:** `run.failed_count += 1` was called before `db.rollback()` in both except handlers. After rollback, SQLAlchemy expires all session objects — discarding the in-memory increment. `failed_count` in the DB never actually updated for failed/rate-limited resumes.

**Fix:** Moved `run.failed_count += 1` to after `db.rollback()` in both handlers so SQLAlchemy re-loads the fresh DB value before incrementing.

---

#### 5. Groq Rate Limit — Early Exit Added
**Why:** Once Groq's daily token limit is hit, every subsequent API call in the same run also fails — wasting time attempting calls that will all error. Old resumes (already extracted) were being incorrectly marked as `rate_limited` instead of being reused.

**Fix:** Added a `rate_limit_hit` flag. On first `RateLimitError`:
- All subsequent **new** resumes are marked `rate_limited` immediately (no API call)
- All subsequent **old** resumes (with existing `extracted_data`) are still reused normally — Groq is not called for them regardless

---

#### 6. Email Automation Integrated via Streamlit Multipage
**What:** Brevo Email Automation merged into the Resume Screening app using Streamlit's `pages/` directory. No changes to `app.py`. Three new pages added:

| Page | File | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 📧 Shortlisting Emails | `pages/4_Shortlisting_Emails.py` | Send shortlist/rejection emails via Brevo |
| 📝 Assignment Emails | `pages/5_Assignment_Emails.py` | Send assignment emails to interested candidates |
| 📊 Email Dashboard | `pages/6_Email_Dashboard.py` | Email log, metrics, grouped bar chart by date |

All pages are login-guarded via `st.session_state.get("logged_in")`.

---

#### 7. Brevo Daily Usage Banner
**What:** A live usage indicator shown at the top of all three email pages. Fetches real-time data from `AccountApi.get_account()` (matches the Brevo dashboard exactly). Cached for 60 seconds with a manual `↺` refresh button.

```
📬 Brevo ● Healthy    ████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  46/300    🟩 254 left    ✅ 43 delivered    ⚠️ 3 bounced
```

Color coding: 🟢 Healthy (0–66%), 🟡 Moderate (67–89%), 🔴 Critical (90–100%).

**Note:** Brevo IP allowlisting must be **deactivated** in Brevo settings (`Settings → Authorized IPs → Deactivated`) since Streamlit Cloud uses dynamic IPs that change on every redeploy.

---

#### 8. Groq Free Tier Rate Limit — Known Behavior
**Limit:** 500,000 tokens/day, resets at midnight UTC (5:30 AM IST).

**Recovery:** Re-run the same ZIP after reset. Successfully processed resumes hit the reuse path (no AI call). Only failed ones are re-extracted.

## Overview

This system allows a recruiter to:
1. Create a **Job Config** (manually or AI-generated from a job description)
2. Upload a **ZIP of resumes** (PDF or DOCX)
3. Let the system **automatically extract** structured data from each resume using AI
4. **Score and rank** each candidate against the job requirements
5. View and **download results** from a dashboard (Excel or JSON)

## Backend

### Entry Point

**`backend/main.py`**

Initializes the FastAPI application and registers both routers under API key protection.

```python
app = FastAPI(title="Resume Screening Backend")
app.include_router(jobs_router, prefix="/jobs", dependencies=[Depends(verify_api_key)])
app.include_router(screening_router, dependencies=[Depends(verify_api_key)])
```

All routes require a valid `x-api-key` header. Swagger UI is available at `/docs` with persistent authorization enabled.

**Public endpoint (no API key required):**

| Method       | Path      | Description                                              |
|--------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| GET / HEAD   | `/health` | Returns `{ "status": "ok" }` — used by UptimeRobot to keep the Render server alive |

The `/health` endpoint supports HEAD requests because UptimeRobot sends HEAD by default. Without this, Render's free-tier server would spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity and terminate mid-run background tasks.

---

### Security

**`backend/security.py`**

Validates requests using a static API key read from the environment variable `API_KEY`.

- Header name: `x-api-key`
- Returns `401 Unauthorized` if key is missing or incorrect
- Returns `500` if `API_KEY` is not configured in the environment

---

### API Routes

#### Jobs — `backend/api/jobs.py`

| Method | Path                  | Description                                    |
|--------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/jobs`               | Create a new job config (manual JSON payload)  |
| GET    | `/jobs`               | List all jobs (returns id + title)             |
| POST   | `/jobs/ai-generate`   | Generate a job config from a job description   |

**POST `/jobs`** — Request body:
```json
{
  "job_title": "Backend Engineer",
  "job_config": { ... }
}
```

**POST `/jobs/ai-generate`** — Request body:
```json
{
  "job_description": "We are looking for a Python backend developer..."
}
```
Returns the AI-generated `job_config` JSON.

---

#### Screening — `backend/api/screening.py`

| Method | Path                            | Description                               |
|--------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/screening/start`              | Upload ZIP of resumes and start screening |
| GET    | `/screening/results/{job_id}`   | Get all screening results for a job       |

**Helper: `get_or_create_resume(db, resume_path)`**

Called for every resume before scoring. Handles deduplication at the file level:

1. Opens the file and computes its **MD5 hash**
2. Queries `resume_files` by `file_hash`
3. If a match exists → returns the existing `resume_id` (no insert)
4. If no match → creates a new `ResumeFile` record and returns the new `resume_id`

This ensures the same physical file is never stored twice in the database, even across different runs or ZIP uploads.

**POST `/screening/start`** — Form data:
- `job_id` (int): The job to screen against
- `batch_size` (int): How many resumes to process per batch
- `zip_file` (file): A `.zip` containing `.pdf` / `.docx` resumes

Returns immediately with `{ "run_id": ..., "status": "started" }`. Processing continues in the background.

**GET `/screening/results/{job_id}`** — Returns a list of:
```json
[
  {
    "full_name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "job_title": "Backend Engineer",
    "score": 78,
    "decision": "shortlisted",
    "decision_reason": "Required skills matched 4/5; Nice-to-have skills matched 2/3; ...",
    "processed_at": "2026-03-08T10:00:00"
  }
]
```

---

### Services

#### `backend/services/resume_processor.py`

Handles raw text extraction from resume files before passing to AI.

- `extract_text_from_pdf(path)` — Uses `pdfplumber` to extract text page by page
- `extract_text_from_docx(path)` — Uses `python-docx` to extract paragraph text
- `process_single_resume(resume_path)` — Dispatches to the correct extractor by file extension, then calls `extract_resume_data()` to get structured AI output

Raises exceptions for unsupported formats or empty resume content.

**Note:** pdfminer (used internally by pdfplumber) is suppressed to `ERROR` level at module load time to eliminate noisy `FontBBox` warnings from PDFs with malformed font descriptors. Text extraction is unaffected.

---

#### `backend/services/resume_ai_extractor.py`

Sends raw resume text to Groq (LLaMA 3.1 8B Instant) and returns structured JSON.

- Model: `llama-3.1-8b-instant`
- Temperature: `0.1` (low, for deterministic extraction)
- Uses `RESUME_EXTRACTION_PROMPT` as the system message

Returns a dict with keys: `personal_details`, `skills`, `education`, `projects`, `experience_years`.

Raises `ValueError` if the model does not return valid JSON.

---

#### `backend/services/ai_service.py`

Sends a job description to Groq and returns a structured job config JSON.

- Model: `llama-3.1-8b-instant`
- Temperature: `0.2`
- Uses `JOB_CONFIG_PROMPT` as the system message
- Calls `normalize_scoring_weights()` to ensure weights always sum to 100

**`normalize_scoring_weights(weights)`**:
- If weights are on a 0–1 float scale → multiplies by 100
- If weights are integers that don't sum to 100 → proportionally rescales
- Otherwise → returns as-is

This guard exists because the AI model occasionally outputs weights in the wrong scale or with rounding errors.

---

#### `backend/services/scoring_engine.py`

Scores a candidate resume against a job config. Returns `(score: int, reason: str)`.

**Scoring categories:**

| Category            | `scoring_weights` key     | How it's scored                                              |
|---------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Required Skills     | `required_skills`         | `(matched / total_required) × weight`                       |
| Nice-to-have Skills | `nice_to_have_skills`     | `(matched / total_nice) × weight`                           |
| Projects            | `projects`                | +10 per domain-matched project, capped at the weight value  |
| Education           | `education`               | Full weight if any degree matches requirements               |
| Eligibility         | `eligibility`             | Full weight if `candidate_type` is `any` or `student`       |

- Final score is capped at 100
- Decision threshold: `shortlisted` if score ≥ 60, otherwise `rejected`
- Text normalization applied before all comparisons: lowercase, remove dots, replace slashes with spaces

---

### AI Prompts

#### `backend/prompts/recruiter_prompt.py`

System prompt for job config generation. Instructs the AI to output a strict JSON schema:

```json
{
  "required_skills": ["Python", "FastAPI"],
  "nice_to_have_skills": ["Docker"],
  "education_requirements": ["B.Tech", "B.E"],
  "candidate_type": "experienced",
  "project_expectations": {
    "domains": ["backend", "api"]
  },
  "scoring_weights": {
    "required_skills": 40,
    "nice_to_have_skills": 20,
    "projects": 20,
    "education": 10,
    "eligibility": 10
  }
}
```

Key rules enforced in the prompt: all `scoring_weights` must be integers summing to exactly 100; no markdown; no hallucination; no missing keys.

---

#### `backend/prompts/resume_extraction_prompt.py`

System prompt for resume data extraction. Instructs the AI to output:

```json
{
  "personal_details": {
    "full_name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "phone": "+91XXXXXXXXXX"
  },
  "skills": ["Python", "SQL", "React"],
  "education": [
    { "degree": "B.Tech", "field": "Computer Science", "institution": "XYZ University" }
  ],
  "projects": [
    { "title": "Chat App", "domain": "backend", "tech_stack": ["Node.js", "MongoDB"] }
  ],
  "experience_years": 2
}
```

Key rules: no hallucination of names/emails/degrees, conservative domain inference (e.g. "web", "backend", "ai", "ml").

---

## Frontend

### App Pages / Tabs

**`frontend/app.py`**

Main Streamlit app with session-based login and three tabs. Three additional email pages are loaded automatically by Streamlit from the `pages/` directory and appear in the sidebar.

#### Login Page
- Username/password checked against `st.secrets["APP_USERNAME"]` and `st.secrets["APP_PASSWORD"]`
- Session stored in `st.session_state.logged_in`
- All `pages/` files guard themselves with `if not st.session_state.get("logged_in"): st.stop()`

#### Tab 1 — Resume Screening
1. Loads all available jobs from the backend
2. User selects a job and uploads a `.zip` file
3. On "Start Screening", posts to `/screening/start` with `job_id`, `batch_size=10`, and the zip file
4. Returns `run_id` immediately; processing continues in the background

#### Tab 2 — Job Config Builder

### API Client

**`frontend/api_client.py`**

Helper functions that wrap all HTTP calls to the backend.

| Function                        | Method | Endpoint              | Description                       |
|---------------------------------|--------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `get_headers()`                 | —      | —                     | Returns `{"x-api-key": API_KEY}`  |
| `create_job(title, config)`     | POST   | `/jobs`               | Creates a new job config          |
| `get_jobs()`                    | GET    | `/jobs`               | Lists all jobs                    |
| `generate_job_config_ai(desc)`  | POST   | `/jobs/ai-generate`   | AI-generates a job config         |

All calls include the `x-api-key` header. All calls raise on non-2xx responses.

## Screening Pipeline

The full pipeline triggered by `POST /screening/start`:

```
1. Create ResumeRun record (status="running")
2. Read ZIP bytes from upload into memory
3. Background task: process_zip_and_screen()
   a. Write ZIP to temp directory, extract all files
   b. Walk temp dir → collect all .pdf and .docx files
   c. Update run.total_resumes with count found
   d. For each batch of batch_size resumes:
      For each resume in batch:
        i.   Compute MD5 hash → get_or_create_resume()
             (deduplicates resume_files table)
        ii.  Check if result already exists for this resume × job
             → If yes: insert a NEW ResumeResult row for the current run_id
                       but copy all fields (extracted_data, score, decision,
                       decision_reason) from the old result. ai_status="reused".
                       No AI call is made.
        iii. Else check if this resume was extracted for any other job
             → If yes: reuse extracted_data, only re-run scoring
        iv.  Else (brand new resume): extract text → call AI → get extracted_data
        v.   Score via scoring_engine.score_resume(job_config, extracted_data)
        vi.  decision = "shortlisted" if score >= 60 else "rejected"
        vii. Save ResumeResult to DB
        viii.Increment run.processed_count
   e. On any error per resume: increment failed_count, rollback, continue to next
4. Set run.status = "completed"
```

## Scoring Logic

```
score = 0

# Required skills
matched_required = |required_skills ∩ resume_skills|
score += (matched_required / total_required) × weight["required_skills"]

# Nice-to-have skills
matched_nice = |nice_to_have_skills ∩ resume_skills|
score += (matched_nice / total_nice) × weight["nice_to_have_skills"]

# Projects (capped)
for each project in resume:
    if project.domain in job.project_expectations.domains:
        project_score += 10
project_score = min(project_score, weight["projects"])
score += project_score

# Education
if any(resume_degree in job.education_requirements):
    score += weight["education"]

# Eligibility
if job.candidate_type in ("any", "student"):
    score += weight["eligibility"]

final_score = min(score, 100)
decision = "shortlisted" if final_score >= 60 else "rejected"
```

All text comparisons are normalized: lowercased, dots removed, slashes replaced with spaces.

## Configuration

### Backend — `.env`

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
API_KEY=your_secret_api_key
```

### Frontend — `.streamlit/secrets.toml`

```toml
APP_USERNAME = "admin"
APP_PASSWORD = "your_password"
BACKEND_URL = "http://localhost:8000"
API_KEY = "your_secret_api_key"
COMPANY_LOGO = "https://your-logo-url.png"

# Required for email pages (Brevo integration)
BREVO_API_KEY = "your_brevo_api_key"
BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL = "noreply@yourdomain.com"
BREVO_SENDER_NAME = "Your Company"
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname"
```

**Note:** `DATABASE_URL` in the frontend secrets is the same PostgreSQL database as the backend. It is used directly by the email pages to read/write `email_logs`. Brevo IP allowlisting must be set to **Deactivated** in Brevo settings — Streamlit Cloud uses dynamic IPs that change on every redeploy.

## Development & Testing Scripts

These are lightweight scripts used during development to verify the environment is set up correctly. They are not part of the application runtime.

### `backend/test_db.py`

Runs a raw `SELECT 1` query against the configured database to confirm the connection is alive.

```bash
cd backend
python test_db.py
# Output: Neon DB connection OK
```

### `backend/test_models.py`

Imports all four ORM models to confirm there are no import errors or misconfigured relationships.

```bash
cd backend
python test_models.py
# Output: Models imported successfully
```

---

## Known Gaps & Suggested Improvements

These are areas where the current implementation has known limitations or incomplete behavior. They are documented here to guide future development.

---

### 1. ~~`ended_at` is never set~~ ✅ Resolved

`run.ended_at` is set in both the happy path (`status = "completed"`) and the crash guard in the `finally` block. No action needed.

---

### 2. `version` and `is_active` fields have no backing logic

**Location:** `backend/db/models.py` → `JobConfig`

Both fields are defined in the model and default to `version=1` and `is_active=True`, but no API endpoint reads or updates them. There is no way to deactivate a job or version a config through the current API.

**Suggested fix:** Add a `PATCH /jobs/{job_id}` endpoint to toggle `is_active`. Filter out inactive jobs in `GET /jobs` and in `process_zip_and_screen()` so deactivated job configs cannot be screened against.

---

### 3. `file_path` in `resume_files` is always stale

**Location:** `backend/api/screening.py` → `get_or_create_resume()`

The `file_path` stored in `resume_files` points to a path inside a temporary directory created by `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()`. That directory is deleted automatically when the context manager exits, so the stored path is never valid after the run finishes.

**Suggested fix:** Either remove the `file_path` column entirely (it serves no functional purpose currently), or implement persistent file storage (e.g., upload to S3/cloud storage) and store the permanent URL instead.

---

### 4. ~~Failed resumes leave no trace in `resume_results`~~ ✅ Resolved

Both `except` handlers now insert a `ResumeResult` row (when `resume_id` is available) with `ai_status="failed"` or `ai_status="rate_limited"` and `error_message=str(e)`, making every failure traceable per resume.

---

### 5. ~~Decision is computed twice~~ ✅ Resolved

`score_resume()` returns `(score, reason)` only — no decision. The `>= 60` threshold is computed in one place only (`screening.py`). No duplication exists.

---

### 6. MD5 used for file hashing

**Location:** `backend/api/screening.py` → `get_or_create_resume()`

MD5 is used to hash resume files for deduplication. While MD5 collisions are extremely rare for normal files, it is considered cryptographically weak.

**Suggested fix:** Replace `hashlib.md5` with `hashlib.sha256` for stronger collision resistance. No schema change needed — the `file_hash` column is a plain `Text` field.

---

### 7. Batch size hardcoded in frontend

**Location:** `frontend/app.py` → Tab 1

The batch size is hardcoded to `10` in the frontend POST request (`"batch_size": 10`). Even though the backend accepts it as a form parameter, the user has no way to change it from the UI.

**Suggested fix:** Add a number input widget in the Resume Screening tab to let the recruiter configure batch size before starting a run.

---

### 8. No pagination on results endpoint

**Location:** `backend/api/screening.py` → `get_results()`

`GET /screening/results/{job_id}` returns all results for a job in a single response with no limit or offset. For large candidate pools this can produce very large payloads.

**Suggested fix:** Add `limit` and `offset` query parameters to the endpoint and apply `.limit().offset()` on the SQLAlchemy query.

---

### 9. `pool_pre_ping` in DB session

**Location:** `backend/db/session.py`

The SQLAlchemy engine is created with `pool_pre_ping=True`. This means before handing out a connection from the pool, SQLAlchemy issues a lightweight ping to check the connection is still alive. This is important when connecting to cloud-hosted databases (e.g., Neon, Supabase) that may close idle connections. It adds a tiny overhead per request but prevents `OperationalError: SSL connection has been closed unexpectedly` errors in production.

---

### 10. ~~Groq rate limit causes silent mid-run failures with no per-resume trace~~ ✅ Resolved

`groq.RateLimitError` is now caught separately before the generic `except Exception` handler. A `ResumeResult` row with `ai_status="rate_limited"` and the error message is inserted for each rate-limited resume (when `resume_id` is available). Rate-limited resumes are now distinguishable from other failures in the results.
